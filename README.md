# Project Title: Online Code Compiler

### 1. Project Overview
The Online Code Compiler is a web application that allows users to write, compile, and execute code in various programming languages directly from their browser. In this project, we aim to create a simple yet effective platform for coding and testing code snippets, making it useful for students and hobbyists.

### 2. Project Objectives
- To develop a user-friendly web application that enables users to compile and execute code online.
- To support multiple programming languages.
- To provide a convenient environment for quickly testing coding concepts and assignments.
  
### 3. Key Features
#### 3.1 Core Features
- **Code Editor**: A straightforward code editor with syntax highlighting and basic editing features.
- **Run Button**: A button to compile and execute the code that the user has written.
- **Output Console**: A display area for showing the compilation results or any error messages.
- **Language Selector**: A dropdown menu for selecting the programming language to use.

#### 3.2 Additional Features
- **Theme Switcher**: An option to toggle between light and dark modes for comfortable reading.
- **Local Storage Support**: Allows users to save their code snippets temporarily in the browser for later use.
- **Sample Code Templates**: Provide sample code snippets for common tasks or algorithms to help users get started.

### 4. Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js (for building the user interface)
- **Backend**: Express.js (for creating APIs to handle code execution)
- **Code Execution Environment**: A secure environment like Docker or an online service for safe code execution.
- **Styling**: CSS or simple styling frameworks.
  
### 5. Project Roles
- **Student Developer**: Sumedha Mishra, Rajshree Senapati, Arati Rashmi, Jasmin Swain
- **Peer Reviewers**: (Yet to be done)
- **Instructors**: Smt. Barnali Sahoo, Smt. Sipra Sahoo.

| Testing and Feedback         | 1 week         |
| Final Adjustments            | 1 week         |
| **Total Duration**          | **8 weeks**    |

### 7. Deliverables
- A working online code compiler application.
- (Basic documentation explaining how to use the application.)
- (summary of our development process and what we've learned.)

### 8. Initial Budget Estimate
- **Hosting**: Free services like GitHub Pages or Heroku for deployment.
- **Tools**: Use free code editors (VSCode).

### 9. Success Criteria
- The application can successfully compile and run code in multiple languages.
- You receive positive feedback from peers and instructors on usability.
- You meet the project deadlines.

### 10. Potential Challenges and How to Address Them
- **Technical Difficulties**: Setting up React environment in the system.
                              Deprecation of the create-react-app feature.
                              The use of react strict mode.
- **Time Management**:
